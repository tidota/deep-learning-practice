# Deep Learning Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and notes for learning deep learning fundamentals. It is composed of notebooks running code of Tensorflow/Keras and PyTorch based on the following components:
- MNIST MLPs
- Model architecture variations
- Transfer Learning
- Fine-tuning & Data Augmentation

## Notebooks

* [Tensorflow Practice](./notebooks/prac_tf.ipynb): Hello World TF code to learn the model in the MNIST dataset.
* [Tensorflow Transfer Learning](./notebooks/transfer_learning_tf.ipynb): TF code to perform fine-tuning on the existing models to learn the model in the cats-vs-dogs dataset.
* [PyTorch Practice](./notebooks/prac_pt.ipynb): Hello World PyTorch code to learn the model in the MNIST dataset.
* [PyTorch Transfer Learning](./notebooks/transfer_learning_pt.ipynb): PyTorch code to perform fine-tuning on the existing models to learn the model in the cats-vs-dogs dataset. (note that the dataset is from `tensorflow_datasets`)
